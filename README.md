FileBot Droplet Repository
=======

This repository contains a set of examples for calling the predefined
filebot scripts to achieve certain tasks. 

Input files are provides via cmdline arguments so users can also just 
drop files onto the scripts and the OS will automatically call the script
and pass in the dropped files as arguments.
